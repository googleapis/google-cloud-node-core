# API Client Generator for TypeScript

**This is not an official Google product.**

This repository will contain the source code of a client library generator
for APIs specified by [protocol
buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/),
such as those inside Google. It takes a protocol buffer (with particular
annotations) and uses it to generate a client library in TypeScript.
